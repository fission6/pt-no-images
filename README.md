## PT No Images

Remove all embedded iframes, images, etc

Save this to your Desktop, Downloads, etc ...

2. Find your download of the zip file and unzip. There should be a new folder 'pt-no-images' created.

3. Open the following url in chrome: 'chrome://chrome/extensions/' or go to chrome extensions under 'Window' dropdown.

4. Click on the Developer Mode Toggle

5. Click on "Load unpacked extension" and find the folder from the unzip archive above and select it to load.
